# Power BI Repository

Welcome to my Power BI Repository! This repository contains various Power BI projects and reports that I have created. Below is a brief explanation of Power BI and how it works.

## What is Power BI?

Power BI is a business analytics tool by Microsoft that allows you to visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in an app or website. It connects to a wide range of data sources, simplifies data preparation, and drives ad hoc analysis.

## How Power BI Works

1. **Connect to Data Sources**: Power BI can connect to a variety of data sources including Excel, SQL Server, Azure, and many others. You can import data from these sources or connect to them directly.

2. **Data Transformation**: Use Power Query Editor to clean, transform, and shape your data. This includes filtering rows, renaming columns, and merging tables.

3. **Modeling**: Create relationships between different data tables to build a robust data model. You can also create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

4. **Visualization**: Design interactive reports using various visualization tools like charts, graphs, maps, and tables. You can customize these visuals to highlight key insights.

5. **Sharing**: Share your reports and dashboards with others in your organization. You can publish them to the Power BI service, where colleagues can view and interact with them.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Power BI Desktop**: Download and install Power BI Desktop from the [official website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shishir1991/Power-BI.git
